    "- truncated lines\n",
    "  - if there are empty fields at the end of a line it is possible that their separators will be missing, resulting in a \"jagged\" file\n",

    "  - a free-text field containing embedded quotes may not parse correctly\n",
    "- unescaped characters\n",
    "  - the \"\\\" character indicates a control code to Python, which will break the I/O\n",
    "    - e.g. the substring \"\\u0123\" will be interpreted as Unicode(0123) -- which may not be what the file creator intended\n",
